    "### Variable names and Comments - PEP8\n",
    "Good code consists of well named variable, and well explained code. If it's not obvious what a variable is, which can occur in mathematics when algorithms use the same variables as in papers, use a comment to explain what said variable is.\n",
    " Comments exist so other people, and yourself, can look at your code and understand what is happening. Every programmer at some point writes some code without comments. They then regret this decision when looking back in 3 weeks time, and curse their past selves. Be kind to future you, write good comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a style guide called PEP8, found at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.\n",
    "These are guidelines and common practices. Every institution and project has its own guidelines. The most important rule is to make sure your code is readable, and consistent.\n",
    "I will quote a couple of lines though:\n",
    "- \"Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments\"\n",
    "- \"Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your comments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never be read by people who don't speak your language.\""
